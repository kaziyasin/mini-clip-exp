# Mini CLIP Experiment 🎥🧠
*A 365-day journey to build my own small multimodal AI model from scratch.*

## 🚀 Goal
This project documents my daily/weekly/monthly progress as I learn and build a tiny CLIP-style model that connects **images + text**.  
The goal is not to create a state-of-the-art model, but to deeply understand:
- Vision transformers  
- Text encoders  
- Contrastive learning  
- Dataset curation  
- Training pipelines  
- Evaluation & benchmarks  
- Scaling laws and training stability  

By the end of this journey, I want to reach a level where I am equipped to operate as a **frontier researcher** in multimodal AI.

## 📅 The Plan (Short Summary)
- **Daily:** Learn something + code something small.  
- **Weekly:** Add one feature, dataset, or experiment.  
- **Monthly:** Produce one measurable result (plot, benchmark, or demo).  
- **1 Year:** A full working tiny-CLIP experiment with clean code + training notes.

## 📚 Why I’m Doing This
I want to train myself into a **deep AI expert**—the kind who can join teams working on frontier models.  
This repository keeps me accountable, transparent, and consistent.

## 🎬 Recording My Learning
I will also document the entire journey on:
- **YouTube Shorts / Faceless Videos**
- **Skool Community** (“365 Days of Building AI with KYI”)
